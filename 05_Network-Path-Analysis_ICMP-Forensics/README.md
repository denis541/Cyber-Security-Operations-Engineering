## 📖 Executive Summary
This project demonstrates the use of **ICMP-based diagnostic tools** to verify network reachability and analyze the geographical path of data packets. By utilizing `ping` and `traceroute`, I mapped the logical and physical "hops" between a local source and international destinations, simulating a real-world **Network Troubleshooting** scenario.

## 🚀 Technical Implementations

### 1. Connectivity Validation (ICMP Echo Request)
- **Task:** Verified end-to-end connectivity to remote mirrors (e.g., Akamai Edge).
- **Analyst Insight:** Confirmed 0% packet loss and analyzed **Round-Trip Time (RTT)**. Monitoring latency (measured in ms) is a primary method for detecting network congestion or potential **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)** delays.

### 2. Multi-Hop Route Analysis
- **Task:** Executed `traceroute` via the Linux CLI to identify every Layer 3 device (router) in the transmission path.
- **Investigation:** Analyzed the path to Regional Internet Registry (RIR) websites (e.g., RIPE, AFRINIC).
- **Forensic Observation:** Identified the transition points between local ISPs and international backbones. This visibility is critical for **Network Forensic** investigations to determine where a packet may have been dropped or intercepted.

### 3. Geographical Mapping & Visual Tracing
- **Task:** Utilized web-based visual traceroute tools to map the physical location of responding hops.
- **Finding:** Observed the "meshed" nature of the internet, where packets often traverse multiple countries before reaching their final destination.
