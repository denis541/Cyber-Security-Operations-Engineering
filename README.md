**Author:** Denis O. Onduso

**Primary Focus:** Security Operations (SOC), Endpoint & Network Forensics, Detection Engineering, Incident Analysis

## Executive Summary

This repository presents a structured body of applied cybersecurity analysis work aligned with the responsibilities of an associate-level **Security Operations Center (SOC) Analyst**. The material demonstrates hands-on capability across endpoint visibility, network traffic analysis, cryptographic trust validation, log normalization, and incident investigation.

The work emphasizes **operational analysis and investigative methodology**, reflecting how security events are examined, validated, and escalated within production SOC environments. Each component focuses on evidence-driven analysis rather than instructional or academic exercises.

---

## Scope of Analysis

The repository covers multiple domains relevant to SOC and blue team operations:

* Endpoint visibility and behavioral analysis using Sysinternals tooling
* Endpoint forensic investigation of processes, execution artifacts, and system activity
* Network protocol inspection and packet-level analysis
* Cryptographic integrity, encryption validation, and PKI trust assessment
* Log normalization, enrichment, and ETL-style processing
* Investigation of intrusion activity, malware delivery, and data exfiltration
* Post-exploitation analysis and attacker behavior reconstruction

---

## Methodology

All analysis follows a consistent investigative structure:

1. **Event Identification** – Initial observation through logs, alerts, or traffic anomalies
2. **Data Collection** – Acquisition of endpoint, network, and log-based artifacts
3. **Validation & Correlation** – Cross-referencing evidence across multiple telemetry sources
4. **Behavioral Analysis** – Understanding attacker or system behavior over time
5. **Impact Assessment** – Determining scope, severity, and affected assets
6. **Documentation** – Clear, reproducible reporting suitable for handoff or escalation

This approach mirrors real-world SOC workflows and incident response processes.
